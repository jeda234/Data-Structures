TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I had a anothe test cpp file that tested small cases as I was building my functions, but I used gdb
when I was creating insert to see the values that we being inserted without having to print.
I used Dr. Memory because I had an unaddressable access that I needed to fix, even though it 
wasnt able to give me a line I had an idea where the issue was.
